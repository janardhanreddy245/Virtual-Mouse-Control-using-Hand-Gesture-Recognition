# Virtual-Mouse-Control-using-Hand-Gesture-Recognition
The objective of this project is to develop a system that allows users to control a virtual mouse using hand gesture recognition. The system will use a camera to capture images of the user's hand, process these images to identify the user's hand gestures, and use the identified gestures to control the movement of the virtual mouse.
